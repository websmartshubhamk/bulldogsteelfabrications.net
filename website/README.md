# Bulldog Steel Fabrications — Static Site README

## Structure
- index.html (home)

## Run locally
- Static: open index.html in a browser, or run `npx serve .` inside website/.

## Content/Brand
- Assets sourced from live site; replace with brand-approved images in assets/images/ and adjust palette/fonts in assets/styles.css (see :root tokens).
- Update colors/fonts in assets/styles.css under `:root`.

## Future improvements
- Migrate to Next.js/React if needed; keep same content structure.
- Contact form posts to formsubmit.co by default; swap to your email service endpoint if needed.
